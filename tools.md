# Presentation and Demo Tools

Here are some tools useful for making Demos and Presentations on macOS go

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) (FREE) -- an alternative to the built-in macOS
  Terminal application, with better configuration, automation hooks, and easy
  configuration backup/sharing

- [DisplayMenu](http://displaymenu.milchimgemuesefach.de/) (FREE) -- a
  menubar application that makes switching between various screen resolutions
  extremely easy, allowing you to mark your favorites. Great way to set a
  specific resolution when making screen recordings or connecting to finicky
  video projectors

- [Caffeine](https://intelliscapesolutions.com/apps/caffeine) (FREE) -- a 
  menubar application that forces macOS to stay awake by constantly advertising
