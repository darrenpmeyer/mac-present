# Presenting on macOS

This repository contains configurations, notes/guides, templates, small tools,
etc. which I have found useful for setting up a macOS environment to be useful
for presenting technical content (including things like a terminal profile
that is large enough for people to see). This is based on over 10 years of
experience using OS X/macOS to present technical content to audiences at conferences and in
webinars and virtual meetings.
